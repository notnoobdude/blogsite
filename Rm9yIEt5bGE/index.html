      I didn't expect for anyone to come into my life 'til I met you.
      I wasn't planning on falling for anyone so soon.
      That sudden Facebook notification changed everything.
      Fast forward, a lot happened. Things happened. Naturally, magically.
      You found me, and I found myself wanting to be with you.
      It was so easy. It was simple. 
      Suddenly realized, I have something. Something worth keeping.
      I fell in love with the woman reading this.
      I knew I didn't fell in love with you just because I was alone.
      Or because I needed someone to make me happy.
      Or because I couldn't function without you.
      Told myself thousands of times already, I will wait for the one for me.
      And if the time comes that I have found her or if she finds me first,
      I'll do everything in my power to have her, keep her, love her, protect her, provide her, you name it.
      And that's the 'you' and 'her' I am referring to, Ms. Kyla Ling.
      You make the good things better.
      And the bad things doesn't seem so awful anymore.
      I knew right there and then, that this is love.
      That urge to go above and beyond for someone.

      Or so I thought.

      After that meetup, was it because of the looks?
      Personality?
      Incompatibility?
      An expectation vs. reality conundrum?
      Was it because I was "love-bombing" you?
      Am I giving you too much attention that you were suffocating from it, hence, the "detoxification"?
      Who knows?
      If I knew that this would be the outcome of that meetup, I would've decided not to go.


      This digi-card was made weeks ago when I told you I was coding something
      Was planning to send this one to you on Valentine's Day with me there, physically surprising you
      Guess that one had to be postponed, I don't wanna bother you
      The silence between us is so deafening.
      Not being able to talk the way we used to is kinda melancholic
      But I realized, forcing my way to you will only hurt us
      I will not force myself to you now.
      I will love you from afar and in silence instead.


      Because maybe it's better like this.
      Since then, I focused on making the best version of myself. Again.
      Had more and more time of solitude.
      And I believe you did as well.
      That's great.
      I just wished we're there for each other to share and witness our independence. (Pretty ironic)


      We're already distant with each other and yet,
      Here we are, giving more distance to it
      And it fucking hurts.
      Because I keep on missing you.
