<!--
      I wasn't looking for anything when I met you.
      I wasn't planning on falling for anyone so soon.
      But then there was that sudden Facebook notification that changed my life.
      Fast forward, a lot happened. Things happened. Naturally, magically.
      You found me, and I found myself wanting to spend more time with you.
      It was simple. It was so easy.
      Suddenly realized, I have something. Something worth keeping.
      I fell in love with the woman reading this.
      I knew I didn't fell in love with you just because I was alone.
      Or because I needed someone to make me happy.
      Or because I couldn't function without you.
      Told myself thousands of times already, I will wait for the one for me.
      And if the time comes that I have found her or if she finds me first,
      I'll do everything in my power to have her, keep her, love her, protect her, provide her, you name it.
      And that's the 'you' and 'her' I am referring to, Ms. Kyla Ling.
      You make the good things better.
      And the bad things doesn't seem so awful.
      I knew right there and then, that this is love.
      That urge to go above and beyond for someone.
