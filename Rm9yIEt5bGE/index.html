<div><p>Please accept it as my parting gift.</p></div>
<div><p>I could write a book for you and would never run out of terms to write. These are not the exact words that I have in mind while typing this.</p></div>
<div><p>This time, I'm lost for words.</p></div>

<div><p>17th, it is.</p></div>

<div><p>Thank you for everything, Kyla.</p></div>
